We are happy to announce the release of Salmon King Seafood App commonly known as **SKS** 

## History


Some time ago the Browne Brothers decided to create a company dedicated to selling Seafood especially King Crab.

One of the brothers took some classes, read some books and using VB6 decided to create an app to keep information about customers, inventories and etc.

The app was a success... but time passed and VB6 is no longer a supported platform.

The Brown Brothers still consider this apps as a cornerstone for their business.

Luckily they are in the Seattle Area and the bumped with this great company called [Mobilize.NET](https://www.mobilize.net)

## SKS Samples

This repository just provides a general intro to the SKS samples.

- [SKS for VB6](https://github.com/MobilizeNet/SKSVB6) This is the original Salmon King Seafood App source code

- [SKS for WinForms](https://github.com/MobilizeNet/SKSWinForms) using their flaship product [Visual Basic Upgrade Companion or VBUC](https://www.mobilize.net/visual-basic-upgrade-companion) the company Mobilize.NET](https://www.mobilize.net) upgraded **SKS** to a WinForms Desktop App, allowing **SKS** to be on a supported platform with many venues for modernization.

- [SKS for WebMap](https://github.com/MobilizeNet/SKSWebMap) desktop is ok, but nowadays the company has grown so much that it is important to be able to use it on the go. So how can you take a WinForms app to a Modern Web App ?? The answer is [WebMap](https://www.mobilize.net/webmap). You can see a [video walkthrough here](https://mobilize.wistia.com/medias/qblm338uvu)

Coming soon:

- SKS WebAPI. Wow. The business keeps growing and growing. A web app is great, but now they need to expose services for B2B integration or Mobile App creation ?? The answer **ServiceMAP**

- SKS Quality MATE. With so many things, how do we guarantee that everything is working? Quality MATE is a solution for automating unit and integration tests for your WebMap apps.
